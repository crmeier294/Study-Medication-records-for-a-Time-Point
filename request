The following listing is already programmed in Veeva CDB Workbench. CQL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. NOT SQL.

-Listing Title: Study Medication records for a Time Point without the corresponding visit initialized.

-Objective: Listings checks if Study Medication data was entered for Time Point and corresponding event is not initialized.


-Programming Guide/Notes:
"Output when:
EC Time Point <> NULL AND <> any initialized event for the participant"


-Forms Used: EC1, EC2, EC3, EC4, EC5, EC6, EC7, EC8, EC9, EC10, EC11

Below is my CQL Code. It works, but below subject is not expected in the output. See details below

Subject# 00280051:
Unexpected output for EC3/Cycle 3 as Cycle 3 is initiated with date 14-Feb-2026
Unexpected output for EC5/Cycle 3 as Cycle 3 is initiated with date 14-Feb-2026
